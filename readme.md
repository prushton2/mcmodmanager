# Minecraft Mod Manager


This is meant to be a simple mod manager for people who dont know how to install mods. This uses fabric (the better) client and has some mods prepared to download.

## Use

This is a mod manager, meaning it has built in capability to download, remove, and update mods.

On the mod select screen, the selected mods will be downloaded/updated and unchecked mods will be removed if they are downloaded.

If you wish to just update your mods, enter the new version and leave the same mods selected.
