# Minecraft Mod Manager


This is meant to be a simple mod manager for people who dont know how to install mods. This uses fabric (the better) client and has some mods prepared to download.

## Use

This is a mod manager, meaning it has built in capability to download, remove, and update mods.
Enter the version of minecraft you want to use

On the second screen, you can search for mods that are available on modrinth.com, and download them.
Mods you have can be removed by pressing the - button next to their name.

Clicking download will download, update, or remove the mods you set.

If fabric isnt installed for your version, you will be prompted to install it.
